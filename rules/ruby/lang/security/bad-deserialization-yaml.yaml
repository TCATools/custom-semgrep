    fix: Psych.safe_load($...ARGS)
    message: >-
      Unsafe deserialization from YAML. Objects in Ruby can be serialized into strings,
      then later loaded from strings. However, uses of load and object_load can cause remote code execution.
      Loading user input with YAML can potentially be dangerous. Use JSON in a secure fashion instead.
      However, loading YAML from a static file is not dangerous and should not be flagged.
